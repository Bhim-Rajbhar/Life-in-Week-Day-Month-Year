# Life-in-Week-Day-Month-Year

Calculating the remaining time in terms of years, months, weeks, and days based on the user's input for their current age and assuming a lifespan of 90 years.

**Explanation:**

Header Message: The print("Calculating Life in Day, Week, Month, Year\n") line simply prints a header for the program, providing a clear indication of what the script does.

User Input: The script uses int(input("Enter your current AGE : ")) to prompt the user to enter their current age. The entered age is then stored in the variable Current_Age.

Calculations: The script calculates the remaining time in terms of years, months, weeks, and days based on the assumed lifespan of 90 years. The calculations are straightforward multiplication based on common time units: 12 months in a year, 52 weeks in a year, and 365 days in a year.

Displaying Results: The final print statement uses an F-string to display the calculated results in a human-readable format. It presents the remaining years, months, weeks, and days based on the user's input.

This script provides a simple way to estimate the remaining time in different units, assuming a maximum lifespan of 90 years.
